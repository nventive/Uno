# Reporting Security Issues

The Uno team and community take security bugs in Uno seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Wish to report a security issue? Drop us an email at [security@platform.uno](mailto:security@platform.uno) and we will be more than happy to check it out! Don't forget to include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The Uno team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
