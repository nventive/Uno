# How to migrate existing UWP code to Uno

There are two separate paths for using an existing UWP codebase on top of Uno:
- An existing UWP application
- An existing UWP library

For migrating a UWP library, see [this article](howto-migrate-existing-code.md).

# How to migrate UWP app to Uno?
# Step by step guide.

This guide assumes that you have a UWP app, and want to convert this app to be multi-platform.



In short:
* convert solution to use Uno,
* check if any APIs you use are not implemented in Uno.
* if so, you have two options:
	* try to find a workaround for this, or
	* extend Uno
* launch and test the converted app.


## create Uno project
You have two options:

### 1. Adding new projects to existing solution
First, open your app solution in Visual Studio. Then, using the Solution Explorer window:
* Add new projects (right click on Solution, Add, New Project, Visual C#, Uno Plaform, Cross-Plaform App (Uno Platform), using same name as your existing project (APPNAME) with "\_Uno" suffix. In effect, APPNAME_Uno folder will be created, and inside it, APPNAME_Uno.Shared folder, and four 'heads', one for each target platform (as APPNAME_Uno.Droid, etc.).
* while reading next parts of this guide, treat `APPNAME[_Uno]` as `APPNAME_Uno`.

### 2. Creating a new solution
* Create a new solution with the Uno app template for Visual Studio, using the same name as your existing project (APPNAME). In effect, APPNAME folder will be created, and inside it, APPNAME.Shared folder, and four 'heads', one for each target platform (as APPNAME.Droid, etc.).
* while reading next parts of this guide, treat `APPNAME[_Uno]` as `APPNAME`.

### tips for both options above
* description of Uno app solution structure is [documented here](uno-app-solution-structure.md).
* you can unload your .Droid, .iOS and .WASM projects (right click in Solution Explorer) to make Visual Studio use less memory and start faster.

## Converting your code
In simple terms, you have to copy all your content from old project (APPNAME) to APPNAME\[\_Uno\].Shared: all your XAML pages, all code (.cs), and replace folder Strings (delete just generated Strings folders). Copy also all other files and folders you created in previous project.
If you created new project in existing Solution, use Solution Explorer for this.

If your code is in Visual Basic, you can use some simple translators, e.g. https://codeconverter.icsharpcode.net/ . It is not a perfect translation, some issues you will have to correct manually, but it is a good start. So, in Solution Explorer, for each XAML page:
* open .xaml file from old APPNAME,
* open .vb file from old APPNAME,
* right click on APPNAME\[\_Uno\].Shared, Add, New, C#, XAML, Blank Page - use same name as in APPNAME project,
* open both .xaml and .cs file you just created,
* copy contents of XAML page
* convert .vb code to .cs code, and insert it to .cs page - but do not remove constructor, with `this.InitializeComponent();`. From App.xaml.vb, convert only code you added. Take care of "namespace" - should be same as in .xaml (and as in manifest), without "\_Uno" and "Shared" suffixes.

You have to copy also Package.appxmanifest (especially, app capabilities etc.) and Assets folder - but to APPNAME\[\_Uno\].UWP, not to APPNAME\[\_Uno\].Shared. 

Now if you wish you can unload your (old) APPNAME project (right click in Solution Explorer), not only to make Visual Studio use less memory and start faster, but also to be sure you don't mistakenly change something in your old code.

## Check conversion to Uno (UWP)
Try to build your app - not the whole solution, but only the UWP project (choose Debug, and right click APPNAME\[\_Uno\].UWP, Build). If nothing unexpected happens (no errors), the first step of porting your app is done.
Launch UWP project, check if it is working as expected.
You can upload the new version of your app to the Microsoft Store. 

## Check if everything is implemented in Uno
Now, reload APPNAME\[\_Uno\].Droid project if it is not loaded (right click on it in Solution Explorer). Give Visual Studio some time. It will rebuild the Intellisense database.

Look into ErrorList window for warnings "is not implemented in Uno", e.g.
`"Warning Uno0001 Windows.UI.Xaml.Application.Exit() is not implemented in Uno".`

 If you don't have such warnings, you are in luck - your app is already 'multiplatformed'.
You can build for another platform (e.g. Android), to check if compilation is ok. Uploading your app to Google Store requires much more work, and is outside the scope of this text.

 But most probably, you would find some Uno0001 warnings...

## Dealing with Uno0001 warnings

Now, you have several options, from simplest to hardest:

### Update Uno.UI and Uno.Core to latest stable version
As Uno gets new features constantly, maybe the missing UWP feature is already added.
Use Tools / NuGet Package Manager / Manage NuGet Packages for Solution, Updates tab, to check if Uno.Core/Uno.UI can be updated.
Or, check this file: [ReleaseNotes](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes/_ReleaseNotes.md) (skip "next version" section)

### Update Uno.UI/Uno.Core to latest dev version
Or maybe feature is added, and you can use it - with small risk that something is broken.
Check "next version" section in previously mentioned file: [ReleaseNotes](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes/_ReleaseNotes.md).
If it seems that your problem is resolved, install latest dev version (in Manage NuGet Packages for Solution, check 'include prerelease' checkbox).

### Check open PRs (Pull Requests)
Your next hope is that someone already make necessary changes to Uno, but these changes are not included even in dev version (yet). It means that some discussion about implementation is under way, or maybe some tests are failing. But you can expect this feature in some near time appear in at least dev version.

List of open PR can be found here: [Pull Requests](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/pulls).

### Consider a workaround
Maybe feature is not implemented, but some "very close" feature is. For example, maybe your app is using CalendarDatePicker (not implemented in Uno 1.45). But Uno implement DatePicker, and this allows to select date, and besides that, this implementation in many ways resemble CalendarDatePicker from UWP.
So, you can use CalendarDatePicker in UWP, and DatePicker in all other. It can be done using XAML prefixes, in this case:

`<win:CalendarDatePicker Name="yourName" DateChanged="myDateChanged" ... />`

`<non_win:DatePicker Name="youName" DateChanged="myDateChangedDP" ... />`

and add second event handler, myDateChangedDP - it has to be new handler, as CalendarDatePicker.DateChanged and DatePicker.DateChanged handlers have different argument types.

All prefixes list: [platform-specific-xaml](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/doc/articles/platform-specific-xaml.md).

### Search for third-party NuGet packages for Xamarin
Maybe your app sends Toasts. They are not implemented in Uno, but you can use this: https://github.com/edsnider/LocalNotificationsPlugin .
Similar solution exist for using Clipboard, and probably for many more problems.

### Create an Issue (feature request)
If all this fails, you can request adding new feature to Uno.

Before submitting new Issue, check if someone else doesn't submit such issue before: [Issues](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/issues).

If not, use this: [new feature request](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/issues/new?labels=kind%2Fenhancement%2C+triage%2Funtriaged&template=enhancement.md).

### Contribute to Uno
This is best (or: preferable) option, if using newer Uno versions / checking existing PR doesn't solve your problem. Best, but also it requires much more time from your side.
Check the 'Contributing to Uno' documentation for guides to [building Uno](uno-development/debugging-uno-ui.md), [creating samples](uno-development/working-with-the-samples-apps.md), [basic philosophy of working with Uno](contributing/guidelines/first-steps.md) and other topics.

### Make a stripped-down version
As last resort, you can make some app functions work only under Windows, and WASM/iOS/Android versions somehow limited.


Now it is time for compiling and test for platforms other than UWP.

## special case: migrating app to Android

### Connect Android device
Similar to connecting Windows device - you have to enable debugging.
So, go to Settings > System > About , then tap the Build number seven times. This unhides Settings > System > Developer options. In this screen, you can enable USB debugging.

### Steps before compiling
Before you build/run app as Android, you should open .Droid project properties (right click on project in Solution Explorer), and:
1. in Application tab, check target framework (should be 9.0 - requirement, if you want to put app in Google Store)
2. in Android Manifest tab, check/enter
* app name,
* package name (in format `<yourid>.<app>` - app will be available in Store at link: `https://play.google.com/apps?id=<yourid>.<app>)`
* version number - (integer) number of your build
* version name - (string) set it to same value as in Manifest for UWP, in format 1.2.3.4
* minimum API version
* permissions - see [permission dictionary](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html) and [features](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element) - it is not sufficient to add e.g. uses-permission for location, you have to add uses-feature location also.
* you can also convert .UWP\Assets\SmallTile.scale-100.png to .Droid\Resources\drawable\Icon.png by resizing from 71x71 to 72x72

### compile and test
Build `Debug`, `Any CPU` configuration.
Prepare to long delay when app starts on Android device.
If all is ok (as it should be, with great probability), you can send app to e.g. Google Store. You can use [this tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/xamarin-android/example/29653/preparing-your-apk-in-the-visual-studio).
