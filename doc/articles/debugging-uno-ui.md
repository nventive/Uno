# Building and Debugging Uno.UI

## Building Uno.UI

Using Visual Studio 2017 (15.5 or later):
* Open the [Uno.UI.sln](/src/Uno.UI.sln)
* Select the Uno.UI project
* Build

Inside Visual Studio, the number of platforms is restricted to limit the compilation time.

## Microsoft Source Link support
Uno.UI supports [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/) and it now possible to
step into Uno.UI without downloading the repository.

Make sure **Enable source link support** check box is checked in **Tools** / **Options**
/ **Debugging** / **General** properties page. 

## Debugging Uno.UI

To debug Uno.UI inside of an existing project, the simplest way (until Microsoft provides a better way to avoid overriding the global cache) is to :
* Install a published `Uno.UI` package in a project you want to debug, taking note of the version number.
* Rename [crosstargeting_override.props.sample](/src/crosstargeting_override.props.sample) to `crosstargeting_override.props`
* Uncomment the `UnoNugetOverrideVersion` node
* Change the version number to the package you installed at the first step
* Build your solution.

> Note: This overrides your local nuget cache, making the cache inconstent with the binaries you just built. 
To ensure that the file you have in your cache a correct, either clear the cache, or observe the properties of the `Uno.UI.dll` file, where the
product version should contain a git CommitID.

Once Uno.UI built, open the files you want to debug inside the solution running the application you need to debug, and set breakpoints there.

## Troubleshooting Source Generation

When building, if you're having build error messages that looks like one of those:

- `the targets [Microsoft.Build.Execution.TargetResult] failed to execute.`
- `error : Project has no references.`

There may be issues with the analysis of the project's source or configuration.

**Security notice: That `binlog` files produced below should never be published in a public location, as they may contain private information, such as source files. Make sure to provide those in private channels after review.**

The Source Generation tooling diagnostics can be enabled as follows:

- In the project file that fails to build, in the first `PropertyGroup` node, add the following content:
```xml
<UnoSourceGeneratorUnsecureBinLogEnabled>true</UnoSourceGeneratorUnsecureBinLogEnabled>
```
- Make to update or add the `Uno.SourceGenerationTasks` to the latest version
- When building, in the inner `obj` folders, a set of `.binlog` files are generated that can be opened with the [msbuild log viewer](http://msbuildlog.com/) and help the troubleshooting of the generation errors.
- Once you've reviewed the files, you may provide those as a reference for troubleshooting to the Uno maintainers. 
- The best way to provide those file for troubleshooting is to make a zip archive of the whole solution folder without cleaning it, so it contains the proper diagnostics `.binlog` files.

**Make sure to remove the `UnoSourceGeneratorUnsecureBinLogEnabled` property once done.**
