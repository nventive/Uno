# Developing with Uno.UI

## Pre-requisites

* Visual Studio 2017 15.5 or later, with :
	* Xamarin component, with the iOS Remote Simulator installed
	* A working Mac with Visual Studio for Mac, XCode 8.2 or later installed
	* The google Android x86 emulators

Visual Studio for Mac is supported, but the editing capabilities are currently limited.

## Create a new project

See the [Uno.Quickstart](https://github.com/nventive/Uno.QuickStart) repository for a simple example.

## General Guidelines for Developing with Uno.UI

* **Always develop for Windows UWP first**. Uno.UI uses the same namespaces and 
conventions as UWP's XAML, which allows for a better use of Visual Studio
debugging tools sur as Xaml Edit and Continue, and C# Edit and Continue. The compilation is also much faster, making the development inner loop more efficient.
* When creating platform specific XAML, **make sure to wrap this specifity inside of
a user control**, or a control style. This makes for cleaner code when the control is used.
* When writing platform specific code, **always create partial classes and not conditional 
code that uses #if pre-compiler directives**. If the implementation becomes too large, consider
abstracting the implementation using a common interface.
* A platform specific code file **should always have an appropriate suffix** (.android.cs, .ios.cs, .uwp.cs, .xamarin.cs, ...)
* Uno.UI is not a perfect implementation of UWP's XAML, which means that there will be compatibility issues. When you 
encounter one, a few approaches can be taken:
 1. **Always report the issue to the Uno.UI maintainers**. This may be a known issue, for which there may be known 
    workaround or guidance on how to handle the issue.
 1. **Try to find a UWP-compatible workaround**, possibly non-breaking, meaning that the added Xaml produces the
    same behavior for all platforms, even if it does not conform to the expected UWP behavior.
 1. **Make the Xaml code conditional to Uno.UI**, using xml namespaces. Note that using 
    this technique exposes the app's code to behaviors breaking changes.

## Bootstrapping Uno.UI

### Enable console logging

Uno provides a simple logging infrastructure through the Uno.Logging namespace.

The LogManager is the entry point to get the loggers, and Uno.UI provides a default Console
logger that may output content in Android's LogCat, or iOS syslog.

Here's how enable it :

```csharp
	Uno.Logging.LogManager.LoggerSelector = Uno.Logging.ConsoleLogger.Instance.GetLog;
	Uno.Logging.ConsoleLogger.Instance.LogLevel = Uno.Logging.LogLevel.Warn;

	Uno.Logging.ConsoleLogger.Instance.Filter = (level, name, message, exception) =>
	{
        // Provides a list of loggers that should be displayed to the console
		var passList = new[] {
			"Windows.UI.Xaml.VisualStateManager",
			"Windows.UI.Xaml.VisualStateGroup",
			"Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RadioButton",
		};

		return passList.Any(n => name.StartsWith(n))
			? Uno.Logging.ConsoleLogger.FilterResult.Pass : Uno.Logging.ConsoleLogger.FilterResult.Ignore;
	};
```

Note that enabling debug logging may significantly slow down the application. It is **strongly** 
suggested to keep the logging level to **LogLevel.Warn**.

## Troubleshooting Uno.UI Xaml Pages 

When building, the Uno.UI code generator produces .cs files that are
located in the **MyApp.[iOS|Android]\Obj\[Platform]** folder.

You may see those files in Visual Studio by selecting this project in the Solution Explorer, then click
the **Show all Files** icon at the top.

If you notice an issue, or an error in the commented code of the generated file, you may need to alter you Xaml.

## Configure the Manifest for the WebAssembly Head
In your WASM head, create a folder named `WasmScripts`, with a file containing the javascript below
(e.g. `AppManifest.js`) and the `Embedded resource` build action.

The manifest file should contain the following:

```javascript
var UnoAppManifest = {

    splashScreenImage: "Assets/AppSplashScreen.scale-200.png",
    splashScreenColor: "#3750D1",
    displayName: "My Sample App"

}
```

The properties are :
* **splashScreenImage**: defines the image that will be centered on the window during the application's loading time
* **splashScreenColor**: defines the background color of the splash screen
* **displayName**: defines the default name of the application in the browser's window title

## Supporting multiple Platforms in Xaml files

The Uno.UI Xaml parser has the ability to manage specific namespaces, giving the ability to ignore or enable specific Xaml nodes and attributes.

By default, these namespaces are supported :

*   xmlns:win="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
*   xmlns:ios="http://uno.ui/ios"
*   xmlns:android="http://uno.ui/android"
*   xmlns:xamarin="http://uno.ui/xamarin"
*   xmlns:wasm="http://uno.ui/wasm"

These namespaces are to be declared on top of each xaml file that will be included in the final binary.

Also, the following ignorables must be declared :

```xml
    mc:Ignorable="d ios android xamarin"
```

This list is mandatory for the Windows Xaml parser to ignore non-windows markup.

On Xamarin based platforms, the Uno.UI will selectively remove or add the appropriate namespaces so that only the relevant markup is processed.

For instance, on Xamarin.iOS, the Ignorable attribute will automatically be set to :

```xml
    mc:Ignorable="d win android"
```

which will make the win and android namespaces ignored by the Umbrella UI parser.

Similarly, on Xamarin.Android, the Ignorable attribute will automatically be set to : 

```xml
    mc:Ignorable="d win ios"
```

which will make the win and ios namespaces ignored by the Umbrella UI parser.

In the Xaml file, it is then possible to write the following :

```xml
    <ItemsPanelTemplate>  
          <xamarin:WrapPanel ItemWidth="100" Name="WrapPanelElement_SimpleHorizontal" />  
          <win:WrapGrid ItemWidth="100" Name="WrapGridElement" />  
    </ItemsPanelTemplate>
```

Where depending on the platform, a panel will be selected at compile time.

Here's a complete file sample :

```xml
    <UserControl
        x:Class="GenericApp.Views.Content.UITests.MyControl"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        xmlns:ios="http://nventive.com/ios"
        xmlns:win="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:android="http://nventive.com/android"
        mc:Ignorable="d ios android"
        d:DesignHeight="300"
        d:DesignWidth="400">
    
       <ItemsPanelTemplate>  
          <xamarin:WrapPanel ItemWidth="100" Name="WrapPanelElement_SimpleHorizontal" />  
          <win:WrapGrid ItemWidth="100" Name="WrapGridElement" />  
       </ItemsPanelTemplate>  
    
    </UserControl>
```

## Using platform-specific code-behind

There are some cases where the Xaml representation of a layout is not possible. In those cases, Uno UI makes use of the x:Name property to generate a partial method that can be used to alter the visual element being created.

For instance :

```xml
    <ios:TextBox x:Name="MySampleTextBox" />
```

Will force the creation of the following method :

```csharp
	public MyPage()
    {
        this.InitializeComponent();

        c.Started += (s, e) => Debug.WriteLine("Text editing has started");  
    }
```

## Uno.UI Layout Behavior

The layout behavior is the notion of applying margins, paddings and alignments for a control inside its parent. In UWP/WPF, the code responsible for this behavior is located in the FrameworkElement class. This means that any control can alter its own rendering position inside its parent, and place its content properly, regardless of the parent type.

The Uno.UI layout engine on Android and iOS is built in the Panel class, and the layout behavior is applied by a panel to its children. This means that if a control has an alignment or a margin set, if it is not child of a FrameworkElement, those properties will be ignored, and the control will stretch within its parent's available space.

This behavior is is a direct consequence of the ability to mix native and Uno.UI controls.

## Dependency Properties

Uno.UI allows the sharing of [Dependency Property] (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752914%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) declaration and 
code between Windows and Xamarin based platforms.

Declaring a dependency property in Uno UI requires a class to implement the  
interface `DependencyProperty`, to gain access to the GetValue and SetValue methods.

Here is an example of declaration:

```csharp
    public class ControlTemplateTest : Control  
    {  
       public string MyCustomContent  
       {  
          get { return (string)GetValue(MyCustomContentProperty); }  
          set { SetValue(MyCustomContentProperty, value); }  
       }
    
       public static readonly DependencyProperty MyCustomContentProperty =  
             DependencyProperty.Register("MyCustomContent", typeof(string), typeof(ControlTemplateTest), new PropertyMetadata(null));  
    }
```

In visual studio, this code can be created using the `propdp`
[code snippet](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165392.aspx).

## Creating a Control Template  

Uno.UI provides the ability to create control templates, which provide another way of creating multi-platform user interfaces.

For the following control class :  

```csharp
    public class MyUserControl : Control  
    {  
        public string MyCustomContent  
        {  
            get { return (string)GetValue(MyCustomContentProperty); }  
            set { SetValue(MyCustomContentProperty, value); }  
        }
    
        public static readonly DependencyProperty MyCustomContentProperty =  
             DependencyProperty.Register("MyCustomContent", typeof(string), typeof(MyUserControl), new PropertyMetadata(null));  
    }
```

Which exposes a `MyCustomContent` property, it is then possible to apply a template that uses template bindings :

```xml
    <UserControl
        x:Class="GenericApp.Views.Pages.Main.MyUserControl"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:local="using:GenericApp.Views.Pages.Main"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        mc:Ignorable="d"
        d:DesignHeight="300"
        d:DesignWidth="400">
     <UserControl.Template>
      <ControlTemplate>
       <StackPanel>
        <TextBlock Text="My user control" />
        <TextBlock Text="{TemplateBinding MyCustomContent}" />
       </StackPanel>
      </ControlTemplate>
     </UserControl.Template>
    
    </UserControl>
```

Where the bindings applied to the control on the MyHeader property will be propagated to the template binding automatically.

## Using Static Resources

Uno.UI currently supports Static Resources using a two-level scope resolution.

*   If a static resource is declared in a Xaml file for which the root element **is not** a ResourceDictionary, the static resources will only be available in this file.
*   If a static resource is declared in a Xaml file for which the root element **is** a ResourceDictionary, the static resource will be available for all Xaml files of the application.

The local scope takes precedence over the global scope.

Uno.UI generates a file named GlobalStaticResources, which contains :

*   Static members for all the available resources.
*   A method called FindResource which takes a resource name to find.

Uno.UI also generates a nested class named StaticResources in all non-ResourceDictionary Xaml files, using the same static members and FindResource method.

## Using Styles

Uno.UI supports the [authoring of styles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.style.aspx).

## Localization

Localization is done through the `resw` files in the current project. Resources are then used using `x:Uid`.

See [Localize strings in your UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-resources/localize-strings-ui-manifest).

Note that the default language can be defined using the `DefaultLanguage` property, using an IETF Language Tag (e.g. `en` or `fr-FR`).

## Supported Uno.UI Controls

### Grid

The grid control is implemented as a best effort in terms of compatibility with UWP.

For more information, see the [Grid class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.grid.aspx).

### Border

See the [Border control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.border.aspx).

### Button

The button control is implemented by default using a ControlTemplate that contains a bindable native button, that binds that the Content property as a string, and propagates the CanExecute of a databound command.

For more information, see the [Button class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.button.aspx).

### CheckBox

The CheckBox control is implemented by default using a ControlTemplate that contains a bindable native CheckBox, that binds that the Content property as a string, IsChecked as a boolean, and propagates the CanExecute of a databound command.

For more information, see the [CheckBox class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.checkbox.aspx).

### HyperLinkButton

For more information, see the [HyperLinkButton](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.hyperlinkbutton.aspx) class.

### RadioButton

The RadioButton control is implemented by default using a ControlTemplate that contains a bindable native CheckBox, that binds that the Content property as a string, IsChecked as a boolean, and propagates the CanExecute of a databound command.

For more information, see the [RadioButton clas](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.radiobutton.aspx).

### ComboBox

The ComboBox control is implemented by default using a ControlTemplate that contains a bindable native CheckBox, that binds that the Content property as a string, IsChecked as a boolean, and propagates the CanExecute of a databound command.

For more information, see the [ComboBox class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.combobox.aspx).

### ContentControl

For more information, see the [ContentControl class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.contentcontrol.aspx).

### ContentPresenter

For more information, see the [ContentPresenter class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.contentpresenter.aspx).

### Control

For more information, see [Control class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.control.aspx).

### Expander

The expander control has the ability to display a header text, and some content to be expanded when tapping the header.

### GridView

For more information, see [Control class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.control.aspx).

### Image

For more information, see [Image class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.image.aspx).


### ImageSource

By default, Uno.UI provides a working but slow way to download images from external sources.

For both platforms, the `ImageSource.DefaultDownloader` can be set to an instance
of `IImageSourceDownloader`, which provides a localy downloaded representation of the remote file.

On Android, to handle the loading of images, the Image control has to be provided a 
ImageSource.DefaultImageLoader such as the [Android Universal Image Loader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader).

This package is installed by default when using the [Uno Cross-Platform solution templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nventivecorp.uno-platform-addin),
or you can install the [nventive.UniversalImageLoader](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nventive.UniversalImageLoader/) and call the following code
from your application's App constructor :

```csharp
private void ConfigureUniversalImageLoader()
{
	// Create global configuration and initialize ImageLoader with this config
	ImageLoaderConfiguration config = new ImageLoaderConfiguration
		.Builder(Context)
		.Build();

	ImageLoader.Instance.Init(config);

	ImageSource.DefaultImageLoader = ImageLoader.Instance.LoadImageAsync;
}
```

On iOS, bundle images can be selected using "bundle://" (e.g. bundle:///SplashScreen). When selecting the bundle resource, do not include the zoom factor, nor the file extension.

The `ms-appx:///` format is also supported for local assets resolution.

### ItemsControl

For more information, see [ItemsControl class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.aspx).

### ListView

For more information, see [ListView class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.listview.aspx).

### Page

For more information, see the [Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.page.aspx) class.

### Panel

For more information, see the [Panel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.panel.aspx) class.

When implementing a custom `Panel` or `FrameworkElement` via `MeasureOverride` and `ArrangeOverride`, measuring 
and arranging the children must be done through `MeasureElement` and `ArrangeElement`. This is different from UWP where one should 
call `element.Measure` and `element.Arrange`.

### PasswordBox

For more information, see the [PasswordBox](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.passwordbox.aspx) class.

### StackPanel

For more information, see the [StackPanel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.stackpanel.aspx) class.

### TextBlock

The Uno.UI TextBlock supports the Text property as well as the
 [Inlines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textblock.inlines.aspx) property
 using [Runs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.documents.run.aspx).

For more information, see the [TextBlock](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textblock.aspx) class.

#### Custom Fonts on Android
Fonts must be placed in the `Assets` folder of the head project, matching the path of the fonts in Windows, and marked as `AndroidAsset`.
The format is the same as Windows, as follows:

```xml
<Setter Property="FontFamily" Value="/Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf#Roboto" />
```
   or
```xml
<Setter Property="FontFamily" Value="ms-appx:///Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf#Roboto" />
```

#### Custom Fonts on iOS
Fonts must be placed in the `Resources` folder of the head project, be marked as
`BundleResource` for the build type.

Each custom font **must** then be specified in the `info.plist` file as follows:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>yourfont01.ttf</string>
    <string>yourfonr02.ttf</string>
    <string>yourfonr03.ttf</string>
</array>
```

The format is the same as Windows, as follows:

```xml
<Setter Property="FontFamily" Value="/Assets/Fonts/yourfont01.ttf#Roboto" />
```
    or
```xml
<Setter Property="FontFamily" Value="ms-appx:///Assets/Fonts/yourfont01.ttf#Roboto" />
```

### TextBox

For more information, see the [TextBox](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textbox.aspx) class.

### UserControl

For more information, see the [UserControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.usercontrol.aspx) class.

### WebView

For more information, see the [WebView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.aspx) class.

### WrapPanel

Shows a panel's items in a wrapping structure. For more information, see the [WrapPanel class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc295081.aspx).

### Controlling Orientation

The application's orientation can be controlled using the [DisplayInformation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.graphics.display.displayinformation.aspx) class, more specifically, the static [AutoRotationPreferences](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.graphics.display.displayinformation.autorotationpreferences) property.

#### Controlling Orientation on iOS 

In order for the DisplayInformation's AutoRotationPreferences to work properly, you need to ensure that all potential orientations are supported within the iOS application's `info.plist` file.

##### Warning for iOS 9+ Development
As of iOS 9, the system does not allow iPad applications to dictate their orientation if they support [Multitasking / Split View](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/AdoptingMultitaskingOniPad/). In order to control orientation through the DisplayInformation class, you will need to opt-out of Multitasking / Split View by ensuring that you have defined the following in your `info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIRequiresFullScreen</key>
<true/>
```

## Creating/Using Android Activities
At the root of every Android Uno app lies a `BaseActivity` class that extends from `Android.Support.V7.App.AppCompatActivity` which is part of the [Android v7 AppCompat Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/features.html#v7-appcompat). If you ever need to create a new Activity within your app or within Uno you must be sure to extend `BaseActivity` and, if you need to apply a Theme to the activity, ensure that the Theme you set is a `Theme.AppCompat` theme (or descendant).
